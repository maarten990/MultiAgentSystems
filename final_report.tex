\section{Introduction}
In this report we simulate people escaping from a burning building using the BDI framework in NetLogo. We create an environment with people and fire randomly distributed throughout the building. People randomly walk through the building until they spot fire, at which point they try to run towards the escape and alarm any others they meet along their way. The simulation ends when all people either escaped or died in a fire.

Using this simulation, we aim to find what affects the speed and survival rate of such an evacuation.

Additionally, we describe the NetLogo implementation, explaining the functions of buttons and how they are implemented.

\section{Simulation implementation}
\FloatBarrier
The simulation environment is a \(60\times 40\) grid, representing an office space (Figure~
\ref{fig:sp}). The walls (black tiles) were hand-drawn to craft a somewhat
realistic layout of rooms and hallways. One exit (green tile) is placed
randomly, as well as a variable number of initial fires (red tiles). Care is
taken to ensure the exit is reachable, i.e. it is not inside a wall or on fire.

  \label{fig:sp}
\end{figure}

A variable amount of people (ranging from 1 to 25) is spawned, again making sure not to place them inside walls or fires. 

\subsection{Agents}
The agents represent people trying to escape the burning building.
Following the BDI framework, the agents possess the beliefs, desires and
intentions described in Table~\ref{tbl:bdi}.
\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    Beliefs & Desires & Intentions \\
    \midrule
    Locations of walls & Roam & Roam around \\
    Locations of fire & Escape & Panicked \\
    Location of exit &  & Move towards exit \\
    & & Alarm other agents of fire \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Agents in the BDI framework}
  \label{tbl:bdi}
\end{table}

Additionally, each agent has a variable vision radius for detecting fires 
and a radius for detecting people to alarm.

Next we will discuss the agents beliefs, desires and intentions more in depth. A visual overview on how the agent changes its desires and intentions can be seen in Figure~\ref{tikz:flow}.


\subsubsection{Agent Beliefs}
There are three concept that comprise an agents belief state: the location of walls, location of fire and the location of the exit. Both the location of the walls and  the location of the exits are assumed to be known by the agent at the start of the simulation. The reasoning behind this is that we assume the agent to have become sufficiently familiar with the building before a fire has broken out. 

On the other hand, an agent is not aware of the locations of any fires at the start of the simulation. When the agent encounters any fires during the simulation as part of his movement, he will add these locations to his own belief state. When the agent tries to move towards the exit, he will use the information in his belief state to try to plan a route avoiding any fire locations that he knows about. 

\subsubsection{Agent Desires}
We have chosen for a simple model of the desires of the agent: he either wants to roam, or escape. Initially, we set the intention of the agent to roam. As soon as the agent has become aware of any fire locations, the desire of the agent changes to escape. This means he will now try to move towards the exit, alarm other agents by sharing his beliefs on the locations of fires or be panicked. These intentions are explained below.

\subsubsection{Agent Intentions}
There are four possible intentions an agent can have. These are either roam around, panicked, move towards exit or alarm other. 

When the desire of the agent is to roam, his intention will be to roam around. This is implemented as a random movement, moveing straight ahead with a high probability, otherwise turning left or right (with equal probability). This behaviour is meant to mimic normal human behaviour. We are aware that in most situations, a person would be more likely to stay put or go to a specific location, however to keep the simulation somewhat simple, we decided on this implementation.

When the desire of the agent is to escape, his intention become slightly more complex. If there are any other agents within vision radius, he will not move but instead share his knowledge on the locations of fires with them. This way other agents become aware of the fires aswell, meaning they will move towards the exit as well. Because these agents will have a high probability to move towards the exit, they will likely share a very similar path. This means that most of the time the agents will be close towards eachother and therefore within their communication range. The result is that they will not move whatsoever but instead try to alarm eachother continously. 

To prevent this obviously undesired behaviour, we have hardcoded into the system to only alarm others when you have not done so in the previous tick. Otherwise, the agent will move towards the exit, ignoring the cries of the dying.

However, in doing so we inadvertently have introduced some other undesired aspect into the simulation: agents travelling in groups will now move at half speed compared to agents that move on their own towards the exit. For this reason, we have the agents alternate between the move towards exit and the panicked intentions. When an agent is panicked, it does not move, thereby effectively halving its overall speed and matching his speed with other agents moveing in groups.

\subsection{NetLogo Controls}
To provide more insight in the workings of this simulation, we provide a overview below of the controls implemented in NetLogo, as not all of them may be self-explanatory.

\subsubsection{Draw, Save and Clear walls}
Walls used by the simulation are handdrawn and saved in a separate txt file. Upon running \texttt{Setup}, the file is read to redraw the walls.

To use the function, first ensure that \texttt{Setup} is run at least once. If walls are already present, you can click \texttt{clear\_walls} (thereby removing the txt file) and run \texttt{Setup} again to redraw the environment with an empty sheet. Clicking \texttt{draw\_walls} allows you to start drawing with the environment. When you are finished, click \texttt{draw\_walls} again to stop drawing, then click \texttt{save\_walls} to save the new environment, which will now be redrawn every time \texttt{Setup} is run.

\subsubsection{Throttle Speed}
As the simulation may slow down at times, it may be preferrable to watch the simulation at a constant speed. Turning \texttt{throttle\_speed} on slows all steps to an equal speed of 100 milliseconds. This does mean that the overall speed of the simulation is slowed down, however, so this should be off when swift simulations are desired.

\subsubsection{Fire Spread Rate}
Controls the speed at which fire spreads. At every step, we check for every red tile each neighbour, and set in on fire with a certain probability probability defined by \texttt{fire\_spread\_rate} in promille. As a consequence, tiles that are not on fire but are adjacent to 2, 3 or 4 tiles that are, respectively have a 2, 3 or 4 times as high probability to be set on fire.

\subsubsection{Vision}
The properties \texttt{fire\_vision} and \texttt{person\_vision} control the vision in which each agent can observe nearby fire or other agents respectively. This vision is represented by an invisible circle around the agent, with a radius equal to the value defined on the slider. We do not take into accounts any walls between the agent and the fire or the other agents.

\section{Conclusion}

\section{Future Work}
There are various potential improvements to the simulation that haven't been
implemented due to time constraints. Regarding the simulation environment, it
would be interesting to automatically generate an office layout based on some
parameters (e.g. number of exits, wall density, width of corridors, number of
open areas). This would allow for research to be done into the effect of the
layout on, for instance, the survival rate or some measure of traffic congestion.

The agents themselves could be parameterised by some measure of personality; for
example, they could have a probabilistic bias towards warning their colleagues,
or conversely a bias towards saving themselves without regards for the others.
This could even be extended to replicate real-world fire safety procedures where
certain agents (presumably wearing fluorescent yellow jackets) are tasked with
making sure all the other agents are aware of the fire before fleeing themselves.

Lastly, improvements could be made to the communication protocol. For example, an agent could track the minimum knowledge other agents have about fires. That way he would be able to figure out when alarming someone would be useless, as the agent already is aware of the fact that the other agent knows at least as much as himself.
